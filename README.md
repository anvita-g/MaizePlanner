# MaizePlanner

Welcome to MaizePlanner an all in one scheduling tool for Univeirsty of Michigan students!

# Inspiration

Students often find themselves juggling multiple tools to organize their academic schedule, which can be inefficient and time-consuming. Many existing solutions are rigid and donâ€™t provide the flexibility needed to handle complex academic planning, especially for universities like the University of Michigan, where courses, requirements, and semesters can vary widely.

MaizePlanner aims to provide a seamless experience by allowing students to easily build and visualize their schedules in one integrated platform.

# What it Does
MaizePlanner is a user-friendly schedule-building tool designed for students at the University of Michigan. It offers:

**Semester Selection:** Allows students to choose the semester they want to plan for, with a dropdown menu.

**Class Search:** A dropdown populated with courses from a database, giving users the ability to search and select their classes easily.

**Visualized Schedule:** A clean and intuitive interface where students can see their selected courses and how they fit into their weekly schedule.
